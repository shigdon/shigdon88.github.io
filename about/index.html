<div class="blurb">
	I am currently a graduate student researcher in the laboratory of Alan Bennett at the University of California - Davis.
  Since the fall of 2008, Davis has been the place I have called home, as well as my source of my inspiration in dedicating my life
  to the study of the plant microbiome! My wife Tania and I are both passionate about Biotechnology, and our cat Lova can't help but
  love plants too!
