Hello World! I am excited to create this personalized web-space for my journey through life! One neat thing about it is that it is powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot easier than I thought it was going to be - Markdown is amazing! This site will feature notes and comments related to Bioinformatics, plant host-microbe interactions and current events in Biotechnology!
